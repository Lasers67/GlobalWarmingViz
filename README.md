# GlobalWarmingViz

This project leverages Python 3 along with several powerful libraries to create an interactive data visualization and dashboard application. The application uses **Plotly** for plotting, **Pandas** for data manipulation, and **Dash** for building interactive web-based dashboards. The goal is to provide a seamless interface for visualizing and analyzing data.

## Libraries Used

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **plotly.express**: High-level interface for creating interactive plots.
- **plotly.graph_objects**: For creating more complex custom visualizations.
- **dash**: A web framework for building dashboards with Python.
- **numpy**: For numerical computing.

## Installation

To set up the environment, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can do so by running:

```bash
pip install pandas plotly dash numpy
```

## Running the app
```bash
cd src && python3 main.py
```
